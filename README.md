# ASIC Design of 8-bit Synchronous Up Counter using Cadence Tools (45nm Process)

## Objective

This repository contains the design and implementation of an 8-bit synchronous up counter using Cadence tools in a 45nm process technology. The main objectives of this project were:

1. To perform RTL synthesis from the behavioral code of the 8-bit up counter.
2. To apply timing constraints using Cadence Genus during the synthesis process.
3. To perform placement and routing of the synthesized design using Cadence Innovus.
4. To create the layout design of the 8-bit up counter in the 45nm process.

The repository focuses on the physical design aspects and synthesis steps involved in the creation of the up counter, and provides relevant reports and files.

## Repository Contents

- `rtl/` directory: Contains the behavioral code of the 8-bit synchronous up counter.

- `constraints/` directory: Holds the timing constraints used during RTL synthesis with Cadence Genus.

- `synthesis/` directory: Includes the synthesis script and relevant files for the RTL synthesis process using Cadence Genus.

- `physical_design/` directory: Contains the layout, placement, and routing files and scripts used in Cadence Innovus.
