addRing command will consider rows while creating rings.
The ring targets are set to core/block ring wires.
addStripe will allow jog to connect padcore ring and block ring.

Stripes will not extend to closest target.
When breaking rings, the power planner will consider the existence of blocks.
addStripe will break automatically at non-default domains when generating global stripes over the core area or default domain.
The entire stripe set will break at the domain if one of the nets is not in the domain.
Stripes will not be created over regions without power planning wires.

If you are just experimenting and/or debugging and accept the risks, you can set the global restore_db_stop_at_design_in_memory to 0 and try again.
